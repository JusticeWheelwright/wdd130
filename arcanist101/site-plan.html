      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Arcanist 101 will be a site which will assist new Arcanist players in the game lost ark.
        This class has high potential but is particularly infamous for it's difficulty of play and lack of good players.
        This site will serve as a guide to becoming both a geared and a competant Arcanist.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of this site will be lost ark players who have made an Arcanist.
        These players will primarily be new to the class and will not have an depth understanding
         of the class and will require knowledge of every level of play.

        If you asked most players what class they least want in their raid party, 
        Arcanist is always an obvious contender for the top of that list. If you’ve seen them in matchmaking or party finder,
         you have likely experienced them die, do no dmg or both more reliably than almost any other class.
          This is not a class issue as with max investment it can perform as one of the strongest classes in the entire game.
           This is an issue with mechanics and/or build. This site will tell you why your arcanist might be underperforming 
           and how to fix it for the future. This site will go over the general builds and the necessary rotation both for basic
            usage and advanced usage for the empress arcanist class spec. Builds are ways in which you can increase your damage by 
            investing more gold into your character. Rotation covers ways in which you increase your damage without spending any kind 
            of in game material or currency.

      <h3>Rotation</h3>
      <p>
        This page covers ways in which you deal damage without spending more gold. Arcanist is the most mechanically complex class in lost ark in terms of class mechanics. 
        The entire basis of its damage is essentially having an incredibly high amount of class knowledge. 
        The first element of dealing damage is the basic rotation. In empress Arcanist, all of the skills you run will 
        do irrelevant damage when performed without any setup. One of the core mechanics of the class however is the stacking mechanic.
         When you use a blue skill on this character, it builds stacks on an opponent. 
         When an enemy has 4 stacks you can blow them up with a ruin/red skills for massive damage. 
         This makes the objective of the Arcanist rotation to build up blue stacks and pop them with ruin skills as often as possible.
          This is normally done by splitting stacking skills into 2 general groups which are used together. 
          Scratch dealer and Quadra accelerate form one group and 2 stacks of spiral edge form the other. 
          By using either of these combinations you can build 4 stacks on an opponent. 
          The damage priority for ruin skills is celestial rain, secret garden and then serendipity. 
          Serendipity is potentially your hardest hitting skill but does so unreliably and so should generally not be used
           if it results in lower uptime on either of the two other red skills even if there are 4 stacks on the target and
            neither of those other ruin skills are currently up. When you use skills, it builds up your identity meter. 
            When your identity meter is full you randomly draw a card that fills one of your two card slots. 
            There are 12 cards that Arcanist can draw at any point. Knowing what to do when you draw every single one of these 
            cards is the basis of an Arcanist’s true potential. In basic terms, most of the cards which
             you can draw give long term effects which you will use instantly. 4 of the cards in your deck are burst cards which
              give huge buffs for a very short period of time. These 4 cards are Cull, Judgement, twisted fate and wheel of fortune. 
              Whenever you draw one of these cards, you hold it until you draw another one of these 4 cards and then use both
               of them together to do massive amounts of damage. Cull increases your crit rate by 100% and crit damage by 50%
                for 4 seconds. Twisted fate either increases your damage by 0% or 40%. Judgement procs the 4-stack effect of
                 red skills without needing to build stacks on an enemy. wheel of fortune instantly resets the cooldown of any
                  ability used after the card. Balance card on the other hand makes your stacking skills produce extra blue stacks 
                  thus changing your rotation to use fewer blue skills in order to proc 4 stack ruin. The basic skill rotation is call
                   of destiny, scratch dealer, quadra accelerate, return, celestial rain, spiral edge, spiral edge, secret garden.

      <h3>Builds</h3>
      <p>
         This page covers ways in which you can pay gold or farm for things in order to deal more damage. Stat wise you invest completely into specialization and then have swiftness or crit on your necklace as the secondary stat.
         Crit has more damage potential but swift is more comfortable to run and can make up for low level cooldown gems. 
         Engravings are empress’ grace, grudge, hit master, barricade/raid captain, cursed doll and adrenaline. 
         If you run Adrenaline, you can take a swift stat. Empress arcanist uses 3 dmg gems on Celestial rain, secret garden and 
         serendipity and cooldown gems on every skill. Getting all level 5 gems is one of the cheapest ways you can increase your 
         damage and uptime by a lot. Prioritize leveling tripods. Tripod levels make up more than 20% of ur crit rate, 25% of your 
         crit damage and at least 60% of your damage. Maxing your tripods is the single fastest and one of the cheapest ways you can 
         possibly increase your damage. If you do not have high level tripods, get them first. Once you hit item level 1445 you can 
         acquire relic gear. Empress Arcanist uses 6 piece nightmare flower. This set has 2 modes; One mode which increases raw damage 
         when you have high mana called magick addiction and another that reduces cooldowns and increases character speed by a lot when 
         you have low mana called boundless mana. Arcanist also gets universal damage increases at level 55 and 60 due to ruin dmg 
         scaling with combat level and not skill level. It is vital to attain as many skill point potions as possible both to make 
         the class feel better and to make the use of the raid captain engraving viable for empress arcanist. If you do not have 
         enough skill points to level all skills to 10 besides quadra accelerate, it is recommended you build barricade rather 
         than raid captain in your engravings.
