        <p class="builds">Empress arcanist uses the nightmare set. This set has two different modes, Magick Addiction which makes you do more damage, and boundless MP which makes you much faster. Empress arcanist favors boundless. The cooldown reduction and speed make the class rotation smoother and the results in more card draw which means more chances to have good damage. On top of this the faster rotation results in more damage over time.</p>
        <p class="stats">Empress arcanist either uses a 70/30 sec crit ratio or a 70/30 spec swift ratio.  All accessories must have specialization, and then the necklace will either have crit or swift as the secondary stat. Crit has higher damage potential but swift is more comfortable to play and can make up for lack of high level cooldown gems.</p>

        <p>Empress arcanist has a set of mandatory skills. You must use these skills. Quadra accelerate is a stacking skill that you can move while using. Spiral edge and scratch dealer function as both mobility skills and stacking skills. Return is your team crit synergy as well as crit damage buff for yourself. Call of destiny is your primary method of drawing cards. Celestial rain, serendipity and secret garden are your damage skills. Prioritize tripod levels for these skills as they will give you massive damage benefits for a low cost. If you use raid captain as an engraving, move speed tripods are mandatory on scratch dealer and spiral edge. If you use barricade, protection runes are mandatory on all ruin skills.</p>

        <p>With Empress, all of your relevant damage comes from ruin proc which is non positional. As such it is recommended that you run hit master. Adrenaline is an easy source of crit that Empress can easily maintain that can be either be taken at 2 or 3. class be taken at either 1 or 3. cursed doll and grudge are mandatory for high damage and optimal performance. The final slot can either be raid captain or barricade ran with protection runes. </p>
