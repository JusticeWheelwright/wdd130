            <p>Empress arcanist uses the nightmare set. This set has two different modes and the following effects:</p>
            <p>This set universally increases the damage of skills that cost mana and halves mp costs.</p>
            <p>Magick Addiction triggers when you have full mana and massively increases the damage of your skills. It also increases your mana consumption. This effect is primarily useful when you have burst cards and want to increase the burst damage that you deal.</p>
            <p>Boundless Mana triggers when you reach 30% or less mana. While in this mode your mana recovery increases. It also increases your attack and move speed as well as severely reduces the cooldowns of your skills. Empress favors this mode for most situations. This accelerates your rotation, increases your card draw and overall results both in a more fun rotation and higher damage overall.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="stats">Empress arcanist either uses a 70/30 spec crit ratio or a 70/30 spec swift ratio.  All accessories must have specialization, and then the necklace will either have crit or swift as the secondary stat. Crit has higher damage potential but swift is more comfortable to play and can make up for lack of high level cooldown gems.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Skills on Empress are mandatory. Prioritize tripods on these skills:</p>
            <p>Quadra Accelerate: Stacking skill that can be used while strafing.</p>
            <p>Scratch Dealer: Stacking skill that can also be used to close distance or jump away.</p>
            <p>Spiral Edge: Stackng skill that can be used to manuever around the boss short distances.</p>
            <p>Return: This skill is your team crit synergy, your personal crit damage buff and a long range counter.</p>
            <p>Call of Destiny: Use this skill whenever you have an opportunity as it is your best way of drawing cards.</p>
            <p>Celestial Rain: This skill is your highest damage skill.</p>
            <p>Serendipity: This is one of your highest burst skills but is inconsistent without proper cards. It is also a fast counter.</p>
            <p>Secret Garden: This is a consistent and high damage skill that can be used often.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Engravings</h1>
    <div class="build-grid3">
        <img class="engraving_img" src="images/engravings.jpg" alt="Misty mountains">
        <div>As Empress your recomended engravings are:
        <p>Hit Master: 95% of your damage is non positional and gains damage from hit master.</p>
        <p>Adrenaline: The crit bonus from this engraving can be easily maintained due to how often Arcana uses skills and has no downsides.</p>
        <p>Empress Grace: This is the largest source of engraving damage on Arcanist.</p>
        <p>Grudge: This is your second largest source of unconditional engraving damage.</p>
        <p>Cursed Doll: Despite the lowered healing, the unconditional damage makes this one of the most viable engravings for Arcana.</p>
        <p>Barricade (flex): This engraving is not as strong as raid captain but still consistent as long as you use portection runes.</p>
        <p>Raid Captain (flex): This engraving potentially does more damage but is also much harder to maintain.</p>
