        <p class="skill_rotation">The first ability that you use is call of destiny which gives you a chance to draw cards. It does nothing for you besides that and maintaining adrenaline stack. After that you use scratch dealer into quadra accelerate. Scratch dealer is first because it makes the cooldowns line up closer and also has an attack speed boost with its final tripod that makes quadra accelerate faster. After that you use return for personal crit damage buff and party crit rate synergy. Celestial rain is the priority dps ability after that as it has the highest average damage. After that you use spiral edge twice to build up another set of stacks and use secret garden to deal damage. You can also use serendipity if you draw cull. Otherwise the average performance of secret garden will outperform serendipity.</p>
