            <h4>If you asked most players what class they least want in their raid party, Arcanist is always an obvious contender for the top of that list. If youâ€™ve seen them in matchmaking or party finder, you have likely experienced them die, do no dmg or both more reliably than almost any other class. This is not a class issue as with max investment it can perform as one of the strongest classes in the entire game. This is an issue with mechanics, build or both. This site will tell you why your arcanist might be underperforming and how to fix it for the future. This site will go over the general builds and the necessary rotation both for basic usage and advanced usage for the empress arcanist class spec. </h4>
