    <p>Hey, everyone. My name is Justice Wheelwright and this is my third on track semester at byu Idaho. 
        I'm majoring in computer science and plan to go into machine learning. 
        In my spare time I like to play video games, read and sometimes write. 
        I think web Design is a practical field to understand and could be 
        useful as both a career option or just as a skill to have.</p>
